# Internship-Project-

I have created a random task generator using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The main objective of this project was to assign Amazon AA's with a task during pre-shift hours to plan for the day shift as an operations manager. This was a fun way to engage AA's with the managers and kept things different for the AA's instead of doing the same task everyday.
